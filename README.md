# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

As part of the project, we have created one R script called run_analysis.R which does the following functions:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The final output is stored in tidy_averages_data.txt
